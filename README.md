# Cokonet Academy Repository

Welcome to my **Cokonet Academy Repository**.

This repository showcases selected projects and exercises completed during my time at Cokonet Academy, with a focus on practical, job-relevant skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting.  
The work presented here reflects hands-on experience with real-world tools and workflows commonly used in professional analytics roles.

## Professional Focus

During the program, I developed and applied skills across the following tools and technologies:

* **Python** -> data manipulation, basic analysis, scripting
* **R** -> statistical analysis and exploratory work
* **SQL** -> querying, filtering, and transforming structured data
* **Excel** -> advanced usage, analysis, and reporting (prior experience further strengthened)
* **Power BI** -> data modeling, dashboards, and interactive reporting
* **Tableau** -> data visualization and storytelling

Post-program, I have continued to focus primarily on **Python** and **Power BI**, as they align most closely with my professional interests.  
However, I remain proficient with the full toolset listed above and use each as required based on project needs.

## Repository Scope

* This repository is **non-exhaustive** and represents a curated subset of my work
* Only selected files and projects are included due to availability and relevance
* The emphasis is on demonstrating methodology, clarity, and applied problem-solving rather than completeness

## What This Repository Demonstrates

* Practical experience working with multiple analytics tools
* Ability to choose appropriate technologies based on use case
* Structured thinking, data exploration, and clear presentation of insights
* Continuous learning and skill development beyond formal coursework

## Future Development

Additional projects and files may be added over time as I continue to refine and organize my work.
